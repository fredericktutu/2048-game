# 2048-game
A stupid 2048 game using C.
This is my freshmen project when I was learning C language. Now back to see this project, I find some redundant code. 
This is actually my first programming project, thus is very valuable to me.
---
An exe file is given, which could run on windows, if you want to run it on linux, just
'''
gcc 2048.c -o 2048
'''
